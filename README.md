# hello-world
ideas, tutorial practice

Hello World! I'm Laykay and I'm a Nigerian.
I started a course in computer science and programming at Havard University through
the edX online learning platform.
I always dreamed that one day I would be a software developer but I couldn't afford
the fees. CS50x has given me a chance to achieve that dream. I hope I don't let
myself down.
My name is Laykay and this is CS50!
